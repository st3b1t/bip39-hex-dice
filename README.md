## Development

After making changes to the source files, compile the project to generate a new standalone page for offline use.

Run the `compile.py` script to merge resources from the `/src` folder and generate a new `/index.html` file:

```bash
python3 compile.py
```

This command creates the optimized version in `dist/`.  
Make sure you have Python installed and `compile.py` available in your PATH.
