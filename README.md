# Hex Dice ðŸŽ² Bip39 Mnemonic Generator

Generate a 12-24 word [BIP39 mnemonic](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039.mediawiki) using hex dice, inspired by: [bitup.space/8ff](http://bitup.space/8ff/) | [iancoleman.io/bip39](https://iancoleman.io/bip39/)

## About the project
This project is built entirely with vanilla JavaScript, without any external dependencies or frameworks.
Only the CSS styles from Bootstrap are included to enhance the user interface, keeping the codebase lightweight and easy to audit.

This design choice was made to maximize security and minimize potential bugs or vulnerabilities that can arise from third-party libraries, making the tool more trustworthy for sensitive use cases such as generating cryptographic mnemonics.

## Download and use offline

Online demo is here:
https://st3b1t.github.io/bip39-hex-dice/index.html
You can use this page entirely offline by simply saving it locally from your browser, the saved .html file will remain fully functional, similar to how iancoleman.io/bip39 can be used offline.

## Requirements

You will need one 8-sided die and two 16-sided dice, as shown below.

## Development

You can work in development mode without compilation by simply opening the file `/src/index.html` directly in your browser.
This allows for quick testing and iterations. After the changes compile the project to generate a new standalone page `/index.html` for offline use.

Run the `compile.py` script to merge resources from the `/src` folder and generate a new `/index.html` file:

```bash
python3 compile.py
```

This command creates the optimized version in `dist/`.  
Make sure you have Python installed and `compile.py` available in your PATH.
